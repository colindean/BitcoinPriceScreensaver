Introduction
------------

This is an ultra-basic OSX screensaver that shows the current average exchange
rate of Bitcoin to fiat currencies. 

It is currently hardcoded to USD 24 hour average and the price text just moves
diagonally upward and to the right infinitely.

You can choose between BitcoinCharts.com or Coindesk by changing the
retrievePrice method in BitcoinPriceRetriever.m. I might make a settings dialog
eventually to make this more user-friendly.

It is meant primarily as something for me to mess around with Objective-C and
XCode.
